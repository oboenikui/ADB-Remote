###ABOUT THIS
ADB(Android Debug Bridge) has network connection mode, but it's a little troublesome for me. I must find a private IP-address of my device and unused port number.
Using this tool, you don't have to find them, and also, you don't have to remember commands.

###REQUIREMENT
Java Runtime Environment 7
Android SDK
